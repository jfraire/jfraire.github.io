.. description: Radial movements in the phenakistiscope
.. type: text

In the `first article of this series </posts/phenakistiscope>`_ we discussed about the phenakistiscope, a rotating disk that produces short animations. In that post we saw a running horse and how it was made to move forward by having less frames than disk stops. Movement was *tangential*. In this article, we will talk about *radial* movements.

Animating radial movements
--------------------------

To make a feature move in a straight line, start by placing the first frame in the disk. For example, close to the border. Turn the disk by the angle of the animation (30° for 12 frames, for example) and draw the next frame *along the line you want to trace*. Continue until you have all the frames you want. At the end of this exercise, you will have a spiral!

This disk from 1833 shows a man feeding a frog with some red balls. The balls are drawn along a spiral, but in the animation, you will see them falling along a radial straight line.

So far, we have discussed two movements: Tangential and radial. `In the next article </posts/a-balancing-monkey-and-a-jumping-zebra>`_ we will talk about objects that move “up and down”, radially. 

About this series
-----------------

This is the second article about the phenakistiscope. In this short series, I describe some of the ideas used to animate the disks. The first article is `here </posts/phenakistiscope>`_.
