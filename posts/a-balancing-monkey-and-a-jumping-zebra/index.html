<p>The phenakistiscope is a rotating disk that produces short animations. It was invented in the 19th century, and the disks from that time are really beautiful. The animations they create are intriguing. In this <a class="reference external" href="../phenakistiscope">series</a> we look at a few of the ideas that result in these captivating works of art.</p>
<section id="a-disk-with-many-elements"><h2>A disk with many elements</h2>
<p>Up and down movement can remind us of the sun and the moon, of birds flying, of sea waves… or of monkeys and zebras! Take a look at this nice animation. Several things are going on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some hoops are turning in-place, close to the center of the disk</p></li>
<li><p>A red ball moves around the disk and goes through the turning hoops</p></li>
<li><p>A monkey swings from branch to branch, close to the border of the disk</p></li>
<li><p>A zebra jumps through two trees at the center of the disk</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="Animated disk of monkeys and zebras moving up and down" src="../../images/monkeys_and_zebras.gif" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><p>The first two elements of the animation are described <a class="reference external" href="../phenakistiscope">in the first article of the series</a>. The hoops are stationary because there are as many hoops as slits in the disk, and the number of slits determines the fixed angle between animation frames.</p>
<p>The red ball is moving through the hoops because there are less ball images than slits. So, the angle between the balls is <em>larger</em> than the angle that the disk rotates at every frame, and therefore, the balls do not arrive to their previous position. They move forward (or backwards!)</p>
<p>But the monkey and the zebras? Well, they <em>also</em> move forward. There are less images of the monkey and the zebra than slits in the disk. But that is not all: They move up and down! And this is very interesting.</p>
</section><section id="moving-objects-up-and-down"><h2>Moving objects up and down</h2>
<p>To draw the up and down movement you can do like before, with the radial lines: You draw the first image, you turn the disk, draw the next one a little higher, repeat, eventually you start drawing a little bit lower, you reach the bottom, and then you draw higher again.</p>
<p>Let’s see that with more detail. You start with the disk at 0° and put your first zebra. The disk turns 30° and the zebra goes up a little. The disk turns again, to 60°, and the zebra keeps going up. The zebra reaches the top at 90°. At 120°, it is now going down. When it reaches 180°, the zebra is at the same distance from the center as the initial drawing. It continues to go down until 270°, when it hits the bottom, and starts to go back up until the last image. This description looks like a sinusoidal curve! And have you guessed what is the shape actually drawn in the disk? It is a circle!</p>
<img alt="Disk of a monkey and a zebra and other elements" src="../../images/monkeys_and_zebras.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><img alt="Fitting images in circles results in up and down movement" src="../../images/monkeys_and_zebras_circles.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"></section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fitting images in circles results in up and down movement when the disk rotates! Another conclusion? This is an interesting way of thinking about sinusoidal waves!</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed two movements: Tangential and radial. <a class="reference external" href="../playing-with-spirals">In the next article</a> we will talk about objects that move “up and down”.</p>
</section><section id="about-this-series"><h2>About this series</h2>
<p>This is the third article about the phenakistiscope. In this short series, I describe some of the ideas used to animate the disks. The first article is <a class="reference external" href="../phenakistiscope">here</a>.</p>
